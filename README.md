## AWS SAM Faces API

#### This application is on hold until SAM CLI 1.0 is released 

This project is my attempt to learn how to use AWS SAM to build a REST API using Lambda.

The SAM build process will not support building with the Opencv library I intend to use until v1.0 is released.

## Resources

See the [AWS SAM developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) for an introduction to SAM specification, the SAM CLI, and serverless application concepts.
